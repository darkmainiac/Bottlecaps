BottleCaps TODO list:
Basically, the mod needs some balancing....

-Assign cap owner on first-time pick-up (and only allow the owner to pick up the caps)

-Create "market" block for selling/buying items that takes a certain percentage of caps as a tax.

-Create a storage block and/or item specifically for the caps. (Remove the possibilities of players trading/giving caps through chests)

-Possibly create a player payment block that looks at certain stats and gives players money based on activity.

-Villagers need to see how valuble caps are in this world.
